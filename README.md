## Overview

### The Original Challenge

The original challenge aimed to create an expenses chart component where users can view a bar chart, hover over individual bars to see the amounts for each day, and view the current day's bar highlighted in a different color. The solution was built using Semantic HTML5 markup, CSS custom properties, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and React.
